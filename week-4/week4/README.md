<h1 align="center">Week 4</h1>

## Week goals
- Build a simple web app with a database
- Follow an effective debugging process for database applications
- Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships)

## Personal Goals
1. Model some basic databases
2. Building a simple web app with database
3. Practice using SQL


<h2 align="center">1. Databases  </h2>

#### Evidence
- [here](https://github.com/DillonBarker/week4/tree/master/diagrams) I have modelled some databases for certain things such as a kitchen to grasp how things may interact

<h2 align="center">2. Web App with Database </h2>

#### Notes
- Once I have got far into the bookmark manager task I will spend some time building a different app in the mornings such as a diary.


#### Evidence
- [here](https://github.com/DillonBarker/bookmark_manager) I have begun work on the weekly pairing challenge whereby we have to create a bookmark manager app.
- [here](https://github.com/DillonBarker/chitter-challenge) I worked on a simple twitter clone which has both back end and front end parts.

<h2 align="center">3. SQL  </h2>

#### Notes
- SELECT -> FROM  (here you can put various arguments such as sorting and putting a limit on number of responses.)
- SELECT -> FROM -> WHERE
- SELECT -> FROM -> JOIN, ON -> WHERE

#### Evidence
- [here](https://github.com/DillonBarker/week4/tree/master/sql_murder_mystery) I completed the murder mystery challenge for SQL, the readme shows how I went about solving the problem.
