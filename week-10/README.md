<h2> Tech tests </h2>

#### Notes
* Working on these tech tests gave me feedback I needed to improve my code quality, through following a TDD approach and writing good tests.
* I attempted using a new language to build the tic tac toe game logic and found this invaluable practice for me TDD approach as I had to apply what I had learnt to a new language.
* Notes on each test can be found at the links below.

#### Evidence
* [Bank tech test](https://github.com/DillonBarker/bank). In Ruby.
* [Golded rose tech test](https://github.com/DillonBarker/gilded-rose). In JavaScript.
* [TicTacToe tech test](https://github.com/DillonBarker/tictactoe). In Python.
