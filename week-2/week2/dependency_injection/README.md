# Dependency Injection Practical

### Key Points
- We use DI so that we can test multiple classes which are linked.
- By injecting the hard coded part into the class via initialisation of that class.
- This way we can then (if we have two classes) test both and use a double to take place (so we are only testing that one class within its test)

### Exercises
- Diary and diary entries
