<h1 align="center">Week 2</h1>

## Week goals
- Use all of week 1's skills
- Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
- Unit tests in classes in isolation using mocking
- explain basic OO principles and tie to high level concerns like ease of change

## Personal Goals
1. Attend processes workshop
2. Work on TDD workflow
3. Domain model diagramming
4. Working on dependency injection

<h2 align="center">1. Attending Process Workshop</h2>

#### Notes
- I found it very useful, I got to watch someone much later on in the Makers process work through the task at hand and found it interesting seeing the testing strategies they used - which were just developed from what I was doing.

#### What I did to achieve this goal
- I attended the processes workshop on Monday week 2. My code for the workshop can be found [here](https://github.com/DillonBarker/processes-workshops/tree/master/middle_letter)
- I wasn't able to solve the problem in the workshop but solved it shortly after and published the new code above.

<h2 align="center">2. TDD</h2>

#### Notes
- Work was constantly done on this area during the paired programming [here](https://github.com/DillonBarker/takeaway-challenge)

#### What I did to achieve this goal
- The workshop allowed me to work on my approach to problems and talking through as I solved them, using irb and unit tests [here](https://github.com/DillonBarker/processes-workshops/tree/master/middle_letter)

<h2 align="center">3. DMD</h2>

### Notes
- The use of Domain Model Diagramming can result in a clearer idea and when paired with testing can be very powerful for developing.

### What I did to achieve this goal
- The practical [here](https://github.com/DillonBarker/week2/tree/master/notebook), this worked on my ability to be able to use domain diagramming to build code, without using unit tests.
- As a result I can see the power of planning over testing, so if both are used in conjunction it is a powerful technique for programmers

<h2 align="center">4. Dependency Injection</h2>

#### Notes
- I used dependancy-injection in my pairing exercise for this week (oystercard), this enabled me to test the classes individually.
- There is a very useful stack post [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/130794/what-is-dependency-injection).
  - It basically says that, on a whole it makes testing easier
  - This is due to the fact that its harder to isolate parts of the class in unit testing without the use of DI.
  - As you will have to directly mock classes that may have difficult behaviour.


#### What I did to achieve this goal
- [here](https://github.com/DillonBarker/week2/tree/master/dependency_injection) I worked on being able to remove dependancy within classes so I can test separate classes using doubles.
- Then I was able to mock the behaviour of the other class I was testing.
