# Clients

### Exercises

- Firstly, I got my server running by using ```ruby server.rb```, then following this i got my client up and running ```ruby client.rb```
- This showed:
```
$ ruby client.rb
HELLO CLIENT WHAT IS YOUR NAME?
Wow what a rude server... I'm going to say Sarah
THAT'S A LOVELY NAME Sarah
```
- Now, the following challenges are:
  1. Get the client and server talking to each other forever (or until you terminate them).
  2. Use the client on one person's laptop to connect to the server on another person's laptop.
