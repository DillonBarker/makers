# Secret Diary Challenge

## The Challenge
SecretDiary
  - lock
  - unlock
  - add_entry
  - get_entries

Initially the `SecretDiary` class is locked, meaning `add_entry` and `get_entries` should throw an error.
When the user calls `unlock`, `add_entry` and `get_entries` should work as desired.
When the user calls `lock` again they throw errors again.

1. First organise it into one class only.
2. Then, when all your tests are green, reorganise it into classes with high cohesion.
3. This will also involve reorganising your tests!
