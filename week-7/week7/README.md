<h2> JS </h2>

#### Notes
* Testing without a framework is very cool, it teaches you the behind the scenes code to an it block and truthy matchers, which is actually far more simple than I first thought.

#### Evidence
* [here]( https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/unit-test-front-end-javascript-code-without-a-framework-8f00c63eb7d4) Is a blog post of making unit tests without a framework. I used this in my project for the week. Which is to create a front page web app, in JavaScript.

<h2> Web App </h2>

#### Notes
* Building my own small testing framework has given me a greater understanding of some of the ES5 notation I was struggling to understand.


#### Evidence
* [here](https://github.com/DillonBarker/notes_app) Is a notes app, built using pure javascript. The lite test suite was built after reading a couple of test blogs, [blog](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/unit-test-front-end-javascript-code-without-a-framework-8f00c63eb7d4)
and [blog](https://blog.bitsrc.io/build-your-own-javascript-testing-framework-377e6583c870)
