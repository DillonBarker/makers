# Week 5

### Week Goals:
* Test drive simple front end web app with JS
* Follow effective debugging process

### Personal Goals:

* Debugging practice in JS
* Test drive a simple web app with JS using CSS and HTML

<h2> JS coding practice </h2>

#### Notes
* Using Jasmine for unit testing, this got me to use spy objects which are similar to the mocking doubles in Rspec. I found this useful when working on the airport challenge.

#### Evidence
* [here](https://github.com/DillonBarker/airport_challenge_javascript) This was an excellent chance to revisit a challenge that was pretty difficult when I first started. Now after programming for a number of weeks tackling it with a whole new language that I am not familiar with seemed relatively painless!

<h2> Debugging </h2>

#### Notes
* Learning to use breakpoints in JS debugger.
* Also learning to use the web developer console to find new error messages, not shown in jasmine or such.
* Testing using the interactive web dev console was very intuitive, the auto completion and prompts help show what methods are available to you.

#### Evidence
* [here](https://github.com/DillonBarker/week5/tree/master/debugging_workshop) I worked on the debugging workshop where we were given a broken fizzbuzz code and told to fix it using debugging processes.

<h2> JavaScript App </h2>

#### Notes
* Involving the use of an MVC pattern. 

#### Evidence
* [here](https://github.com/DillonBarker/thermostat_challenge) I am working on a simple app to show the temperature of a given region, when inputed to a form, it also has an interactive list of buttons which can manipulate one of the features on the page (temperature).
	- This worked on my CSS skills and incorporating an interface which uses code from the model to help build the functionality of the page using jQuery.
